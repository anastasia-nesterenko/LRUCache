# LRUCache

Realization of “Least-Recently Used” (LRU) Cache.

Initialization: `LRUCache(capacity)`.

Methods: `get(key)`, `put(key, value)`, `delete(key)` and `reset()`. 

## Getting Started

Developed by using Python 3, built-in data type dictionary. No dependence on an external library.

Solution files:
 - `LRUCache.py` - class to represent least-recently used cache
 - `Node.py` - class to represent a node of doubly linked list
 - `TestsForLRUCache.py` - unit tests

## Running the tests

The solution is covered by unit-tests; developed with the usage of the `unittest` library.

Execute tests via `python -m unittest test_LRUCache.py`.
